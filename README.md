# Mandarin Peacock

### Credit

A fork of both [daylerees](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes) Peacock theme and the [Mandarin syntax theme](https://github.com/jakedeichert/mandarin-syntax) for Atom.

This uses the Minimal theme from [Minimal-Sublime-Text-Theme](https://github.com/AntoineBoulanger/Minimal-Sublime-Text-Theme) and all credit goes to the creator.

This uses the icons from [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2) and again, all credit goes to the creator.
