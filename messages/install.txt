Thanks for installing Mandarin Peacock!


How to activate

Activate the color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac).

*Example settings*

    {
      "theme": "mandarin-peacock.sublime-theme",
      "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Mandarin-Peacock/mandarin-peacock.tmTheme"
